// If you know a solution is not far from
// the root of the tree:
// Breath First Search (Find shortest Path, Closer Node, More memory)
// Answer: BFS

// If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// Depth First Search (Is there a Path, Less memory, Can get slow)
// Answer: BFS (DFS will take long time)

// If the tree is very wide
// Breath First Search
// Answer: DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

// If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// Deep First Search
// Answer: DFS

// determining wether a pth exists between two nodes:
// Deep First Search
// Answer: DFS

// Finding the shortest path:
// Breath First Search
// Answer: BFS
